Loops are used to repeat actions efficiently. 

A for loop iterates over a sequence, while a 'while' loop continues executing as long as a specified condition is true.

In programming, we keep on repeating. 

Reason of looping

Thank you to having at it

AI generates images, texts, videos.

GenAI will pretrain data from internet, website, image, build model LLM model 

When data is directly trained from internet (data is large)

Openai was the first and more came in to compete: gemini, llama2, llama3, antropic, deepseek, manusai, grok

Look at my practice with google deepmind, a research company of google:www.deepmind.google

EDA = Exploratory Data analysis is the process of analyzing data sets to summarize the sample(s) at hand, often with the goal of deriving useful insights. 

It is a fundamental part of the data science process, and is used by data scientists to understand the data and identify patterns and trends that can be used to make predictions or draw conclusions about the data.  

It is foundational to machine learning and data science, and is used by data scientists to understand the data and identify patterns and trends that can be used to make predictions or draw conclusions about the data.

EDA is also called feature engineering technique.

And more..... to come
